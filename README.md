# GoogLeNet-and-ResNet
 
Due to coronavirus, the original close-book written exam will not run. Instead, we have a coursework-like “Final Alternative Assessment” (coursework 3)，which has a weighting of 35%.

In this coursework, we need to perform and evaluate image classification tasks with deeper networks.
Requirements
1) You should use at least two deep networks including VGG, ResNet, GoogleNet.
2) You MUST use MNIST dataset for the image classification task. Moreover, we encourage you to use extra datasets (such as CIFAR, Tiny-Imagenet) to further evaluate the deeper networks.
3) You should submit a 6-page report including
   a) Critical analysis of models;
   b) Implementation of model training and test settings, including the model training/testing process (the loss changing during training period, the train/test accuracy, etc.), to support your experimental results;
   c) Evaluation on your experimental results;
   d) Run-time screenshots.
4) You should submit your codes together with your report above.
